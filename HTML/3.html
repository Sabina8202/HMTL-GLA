<h1> Northern lights</h1>
<img src="/images/n.jpg" alt = "Northern lights"height="200px" widht="20px">
<p> The <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;">northern lights </span>are also known as the aurora borealis, <br>
    meaning light of dawn. It’s said the term was first coined by Galileo in 1623 and is derived from ‘Aurora’, <br>
    the goddess of the dawn and ‘Boreas’, the northern wind personified. The northern lights and their <br>
    counterpart in the southern hemisphere appear when highly charged solar wind particles flowing from the sun  <br>
    collide with air molecules in the earth’s atmosphere transferring their energy into light. This occurs around the <br>
    Polar Regions where those magnetic fields converge. These magnetic fields create auroral ovals around the top and <br>
    bottom of our planet which move and distort as the earth rotates and solar flare activity increases.</p>

<h1> Mountains </h1>

<p>
    A <span style="color:green; font-weight: bold;"> mountain </span>is an elevated portion of the Earth's crust, generally with steep sides that show significant exposed bedrock. <br>
    Although definitions vary, a mountain may differ from a plateau in having a limited summit area, and is usually higher than <br>
    a hill, typically rising at least 300 metres (1,000 feet) above the surrounding land. A few mountains are isolated summits, <br>
    but most occur in mountain ranges

<h1> Oceans </h1>

<p>
    The <span style="color:green ; font-weight: bold;"> ocean</span> is a huge body of saltwater that covers about 71 percent of Earth’s surface. The planet has one global ocean, <br>
    though oceanographers and the countries of the world have traditionally divided it into four distinct regions: the Pacific, <br>
     Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic oceans. Beginning in the 20th century, some oceanographers labeled the seas around Antarctica <br>
     the Southern Ocean, and in 2021 National Geographic officially recognized this fifth ocean.
