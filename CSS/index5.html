    <h1>Sabia</h1>
   <p> Generating random paragraphs can be an excellent way for writers to get their creative<br>
             flow going at the beginning of the day. The writer has no idea what topic the random paragraph will be <br>
             about when it appears. This forces the writer to use creativity to complete one of three common writing <br>
             challenges. The writer can use the paragraph as the first one of a short story and build upon it. A second option <br>
            is to use the random paragraph somewhere in a short story they create. The third option is to have <br>
            the random paragraph be the ending paragraph in a short story. No matter which of these challenges is <br>
            undertaken, the writer is forced to use creativity to incorporate the paragraph into their writing.</p>
